    <h2>What is a digital menu with a QR code?</h2>
    <p>A digital menu with a QR code is an electronic version of the traditional paper menu, accessible by scanning a QR code with a smartphone or tablet. When customers scan the QR code, they are redirected to a web page that displays the restaurant's menu in digital format. This menu can be easily viewed and navigated, offering detailed information about each dish, including ingredients, prices, and images. QR code technology makes accessing the menu quick and contactless, improving safety and hygiene within the restaurant.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the competitive restaurant industry, understanding and improving customer satisfaction is crucial. An effective measure to evaluate customer loyalty and satisfaction is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This article delves into the importance of NPS, how it can be implemented in the restaurant industry, and strategies to improve your score.</p>

    <section id="cos-e-nps" class="margin-top-bottom-4">
        <h2>What is the Net Promoter Score (NPS)?</h2>
        <p><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong> is a customer satisfaction metric that measures the likelihood of customers recommending a business to others. It is calculated based on responses to the question: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our restaurant to a friend or colleague?" Respondents are classified as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), and Detractors (0-6). NPS is obtained by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.</p>
