    <h2>What is a digital menu with a QR code?</h2>
    <p>A digital menu with a QR code is an electronic version of the traditional paper menu, accessible by scanning a QR code with a smartphone or tablet. When customers scan the QR code, they are redirected to a web page that displays the restaurant's menu in digital format. This menu can be easily viewed and navigated, offering detailed information about each dish, including ingredients, prices, and images. QR code technology makes accessing the menu quick and contactless, improving safety and hygiene within the restaurant.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the competitive restaurant industry, understanding and improving customer satisfaction is crucial. An effective measure to evaluate customer loyalty and satisfaction is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This article delves into the importance of NPS, how it can be implemented in the restaurant industry, and strategies to improve your score.</p>

        <h2>What is the Net Promoter Score (NPS)?</h2>
        <p><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong> is a customer satisfaction metric that measures the likelihood of customers recommending a business to others. It is calculated based on responses to the question: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our restaurant to a friend or colleague?" Respondents are classified as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), and Detractors (0-6). NPS is obtained by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.</p>

    <h3>Introduction: The Revolution of Digital Menus in Restaurants</h3>
    <p>In recent years, restaurants have undergone a radical transformation thanks to the adoption of digital technologies. One of the most important innovations is the digital menu with QR code. This allows customers to view the menu on their smartphones, eliminating the need for a traditional paper menu.</p>
    <p>The <strong> QR code </strong> has become a fundamental tool for improving efficiency and safety, especially in a post-pandemic context. However, to integrate it effectively in restaurants, the right tools are needed. QR code holders and table QR code displays are useful. In this article, we will explore the importance of these accessories, their types, and the benefits for restaurants.</p>

  <section id="how-it-works" class="margin-top-bottom-4">
    <h2 class="margin-bottom-2">1. What is a QR Code and How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>A <strong> QR code </strong> (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned using a smartphone camera. Once scanned, the code redirects the user to a webpage or an app, such as a digital menu.</p>
    <p><strong> QR codes </strong> are very easy to use. Just frame the code. In seconds, the customer can view the restaurant's menu without touching anything physical. This system has become popular for its speed, convenience, and the reduction of contamination risk in environments like restaurants.</p>

  <h4>Creating a Functional and Welcoming Environment</h4>
  <p>The interior design of a restaurant must be both functional and comfortable. The layout should facilitate the staff's workflow and ensure a pleasant experience for customers. Strategically dividing space between the kitchen, dining area, and reception is essential for efficient service.</p>

  <h4>Integrating Kitchen and Dining Room in Harmony</h4>
  <p>An open kitchen can be a highlight of the restaurant. However, it's crucial that the integration between the kitchen and dining area is harmonious, ensuring that the design fosters communication between the two areas without disturbing customers.</p>

  <h4>Bathroom Design: Small Details That Make a Difference</h4>

        <h2>Restaurant Licenses</h2>
        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Legal and Permit Requirements</h3>
        <p>In Italy, opening a restaurant requires obtaining various permits and licenses. These include VAT registration, registration in the Business Register, and an opening permit from the municipality.</p>
        
        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Health License</h3>
        <p>A crucial aspect is the health license, certifying that your premises meet all current health and hygiene regulations. To obtain it, a local health authority (ASL) will need to conduct an inspection of the premises.</p>
        
        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Other Necessary Licenses</h3>
        <p class="margin-top-bottom-1">In addition to the health license, you may need other permits, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fire prevention certificate (if required for the premises)</li>
            <li>Authorization for serving alcoholic beverages</li>
            <li>Public space occupancy permit, if the restaurant has outdoor seating</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are the necessary steps to open a new restaurant. However, be aware that obstacles may arise. For instance, one of the reasons for restaurant failures can be the lack of strategic and organizational culture or insufficient standardization of production processes.

    <section id="why-stainless-steel" class="margin-top-bottom-4">
        <h2>Why Choose Stainless Steel for Industrial and Restaurant Kitchens?</h2>
        <p>Stainless steel is the ideal material for professional kitchens due to its high resistance to corrosion, durability, and long lifespan, outperforming many other materials. It has an appealing look and adapts to any kitchen style with various finishes: shiny, matte, glossy, brushed, or patterned.</p>
        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Easy to Clean and Highly Hygienic</h3>
        <p>The hard, metallic surface of stainless steel is easy to clean and meets the highest hygiene standards. A "self-healing" chromium oxide layer protects the material, making it resistant to bacteria and germs. It’s also safe and non-toxic for food contact, preserving the taste and appearance of even acidic foods like fruits and vegetables.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Sustainability and Durability</h3>
        <p>Stainless steel is an eco-friendly choice: it contains over 85% recycled materials, reducing raw material usage. Outokumpu steel products have a minimal carbon footprint, making them an environmentally conscious choice.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Suitable for All Restaurant Kitchen Needs</h3>
        <p>Work surfaces, appliances, sinks, and hoods made of stainless steel are durable and resilient, perfect for intensive kitchen use. Steel is also highly moldable to meet specific needs.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-top-2">Safety, Hygiene, and High Performance</h3>
        <p>Thanks to its smooth, non-porous surface, stainless steel prevents aggressive liquids, like tomato juice, from seeping in. Robust and corrosion-resistant, it maintains its performance over time, reducing maintenance costs compared to other materials.</p>

        <h2>Why Is the Choice of Chairs and Tables Important?</h2>
        <p>Investing in quality chairs and tables for bars or restaurants is a strategic decision that directly impacts the customer experience. <br><br> When a place is thoughtfully furnished with comfortable spaces, customers feel at ease and are encouraged to stay longer, increasing the likelihood of ordering more. Additionally, restaurant tables and chairs that reflect the style and concept of the establishment can become a true calling card, enhancing the image of the restaurant or bar and strengthening the brand.</p>

        <h2>Wooden Restaurant Tables: Quality and Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>Wooden restaurant tables are a classic choice, valued for their natural aesthetic and durability. Wood easily adapts to different styles, from rustic to modern, making it versatile for any type of restaurant, tavern, or inn, whether in a mountain lodge or a beach “Chiringuito.”</p>
        <p>The main features of wooden tables are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural aesthetic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Durability and versatility</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Suitable for different styles</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ideal for rustic and informal environments</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to give a rustic touch to your establishment, wood will help create a warm, welcoming atmosphere, allowing your customers to have a more immersive and sensory experience.</p>
